| :dash: [janke: tracing conditionals](./js-tracing-conditionals.md) | :white_check_mark:| #3.fixed. #5. becouse ```!x || ! y ``` and ``` !(x && y)``` are the same. #8. becouse ```x || y ``` is *false* only if both ```x``` and ```y``` are ```false``` so ```x && y``` can't be true. but, if we switch exp_2 & exp_3 ```if else if ``` will be reachable.  | :star2: | #2's second if is unreachable, :star2:. #3 "if" is reachable (1===+1 -> true), it's just that you overwrite ```path```: see what happens if you replace ```=``` with ```+=```. #5's second if is unreachable, :star2: - follow the "de morgan's law" link below your solution and figure out why. #6 throws an error, double check your commenting. #8 :star2:, but can you explain why? what happens if you switch exp_2 & exp_3? |
